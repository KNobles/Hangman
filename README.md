# **Description**
A project made as part of my training at BeCode. The purpose was to make us understand and use the concept of **OOP (Object Oriented Programming)** in python in the form of a game called **"Hangman"**.

The Hangman is a game that can be either played alone or with someone where the player has to find a word by guessing its letter at each turn. When the player guesses right a letter, its place is releaved thus making it easier to guess the word every time a letter is found. On the other hand if the player's guess is incorrect, a body part is drawn starting by the head on a rope meaning that the player has 6 lives. If the "character" is fully drawn (head, body, arms and legs) the game is over.

## Installation
Just download the git repository and keep the files path the same otherwise some import wouldn't work.

## Usage
Run the main.py file and the game will directly start by asking you to input a letter that will be automatically converting it into a lowercase so you don't have to mind if wether you can or can't put uppercase letters.

After choosing your letter just press enter to see if you guessed correctly or incorrectly, also don't worry about inputing special characters, numbers or symbols because you will be asked again without penalities to input a letter.

The game ends until you've guessed all the letters or until you've lost all of your lives.
